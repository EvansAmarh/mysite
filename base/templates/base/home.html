            <p>
              You love creating innovative and user-centered digital experiences
              by blending design, technology, and data—whether through intuitive
              interfaces, immersive 3D visuals, or solutions that solve
              real-world problems.

            <h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              My journey as a developer began with the RydeMe mobile app project
              in April 2024, which marked my first hands-on experience in a
              real-world development setting. As a front-end developer, I was
              responsible for designing and implementing a responsive and
              user-friendly interface using React Native and JavaScript. The app
              provided users with access to rides, food delivery, and item
              transport services—all from a single platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              This role challenged me to go beyond theoretical knowledge,
              pushing me to write efficient code, troubleshoot UI bugs, and
              ensure compatibility across various mobile devices. It was during
              this project that I learned the value of cross-functional
              collaboration, as I worked closely with the back-end team and
              product designers to integrate real-time features that prioritized
              user safety, affordability, and fast service delivery. This
              experience laid a strong foundation for my development career and
              introduced me to industry standards in front-end development.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through the RydeMe project, I also developed a stronger
              appreciation for user experience principles, recognizing how
              design choices directly impact user satisfaction and retention. I
              conducted informal usability testing and incorporated user
              feedback into interface improvements, ensuring the app remained
              intuitive even as new features were added. This iterative design
              process taught me to balance aesthetics with functionality, and it
              sparked a deeper interest in building applications that are not
              only technically sound but also empathetic to the user's needs and
              behavior.

            <h5>My Experience as a Developer</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
              My journey as a developer has been enriched by my
              multidisciplinary background. Beyond mobile app development, I
              have worked as a UX Researcher and Data Analyst on the GCGO, Team
              Luminaires project where I identified challenges in adopting
              Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs). I also analyzed trends
              to provide data-driven insights, enhancing environmental and food
              sustainability strategies across Africa.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of design, I held a long-term role as a 3D Artiste and
              Colorist at Hybrid Toons from 2020 to 2023. There, I created 3D
              models, refined visual elements, and performed color grading for
              high-profile projects, blending creative work with technical
              execution. My current projects, like AppointmentPro, involve
              designing UI/UX systems in Figma and Photoshop, demonstrating my
              strong grasp of visual design and user interaction principles.

            <h5>What I Know</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I am proficient in both design and development tools and
              languages, including React Native, JavaScript, Python, C++, and
              Visual Basic. I’m skilled in 3D modeling and animation coloring,
              using tools such as Cinema 4D Studio, Figma, and Adobe Photoshop.
              I’ve also worked with Git, Visual Studio Code, and the Microsoft
              Office Suite for development and documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              My technical knowledge spans user interface design, responsive
              coding, data analysis, real-time feature integration, and agile
              collaboration. I can take a project from user research through to
              high-fidelity design and functional implementation.

            <h5>How I learn</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I learn by building. I thrive in project-based learning
              environments, and most of my expertise comes from solving
              real-world problems. I’m constantly seeking out new challenges
              that push me to learn new tools or deepen my current skills. For
              instance, I taught myself React Native while working on RydeMe and
              quickly applied it in a live production environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also keep up with UI/UX trends and development best practices
              through online resources, forums, and collaborative communities
              like Slack, Zoom, and WhatsApp groups I’ve engaged with during my
              leadership role at SRN MIT Solve.

            <h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
              In the short term, I aim to refine my full-stack development
              skills, especially in React, Python, and backend technologies. I
              plan to explore cloud engineering and real-time database
              integration to better support dynamic web and mobile applications.
              I’m also keen on improving my UX research methodologies and
              expanding my portfolio with scalable, user-centered solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I intend to contribute to more open-source projects
              and take on roles that allow me to work closely with design and
              development teams, bridging the gap between functionality and user
              experience.
